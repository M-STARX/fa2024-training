# fa2024-training
Hello and welcome to M-STARX! The purpose of this repository is to introduce you to GitHub and Python through interactive training. Python is the primary coding language we use on STARX, and we use GitHub for version control and sharing of the code we write. Before going further, make sure you're also a member of the M-STARX organization on GitHub. Feel free to explore our repositories (though a lot of them are outdated at the moment). 

The rest of this README describes how to start the Python + GitHub training module. Feel free to ask Aren or the people around you if you have any questions. There's also links to helpful resources at the bottom!

## Python + GitHub
### Essential Software
If you've coded in Python and used GitHub before, you probably already have these steps complete. Congrats! Feel free to skip to the next section.
1. If you don't have an IDE installed on your computer (VS Code, XCode, Visual Studio, or something similar), follow [this tutorial](https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/). Specifically, step 3 has details on downloading development environments. I like VS Code, but the IDE you use doesn't really matter, as long as you've got something to code in :).
2. Download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and whatever extensions you need to use it in your IDE. You should also install pip by running the command "pip install pip" in the command line. To check if you have Python and pip installed, run "python --version" and "pip --version" respectively.
3. Set up GitHub using [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)

### The Actual Training :)
Clone this repository by running "git clone https://github.com/M-STARX/fa2024-training.git" in the command line, and follow the instructions in fa2024_training.py. Make sure to complete all the steps and push your final code to your branch of the repository!
