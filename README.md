# fa2024-training
Hello and welcome to M-STARX! The purpose of this repository is to introduce you to GitHub and Python through interactive training. 
Python is the primary coding language we use on STARX, and we use GitHub for version control and sharing of the code we write.
Before going further, make sure you're also a member of the M-STARX organization on GitHub. Feel free to explore our repositories (though
a lot of them are outdated at the moment).
